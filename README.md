REHASH is a **Java Desktop Application** designed to help users generate outfits and organize virtual closets. Through the explorer page, users can browse and collect various clothing items such as sweaters, crewnecks, shoes, and outfits, which are referred to as “*hashes*.” These items are then stored in a personal closets known as a “*hashdex's*.” Each hashdex functions as its own individual collection, and users can create multiple hashdexes with custom names, profile images, and tags.

REHASH is designed for anyone who seeks inspiration for outfits, whether it’s for daily wear, special events, or wardrobe planning for the week. It’s also for those who want to build collections as share their personal styles to others who can appreciate their creation. Target audience ranges from ages 12-35+, though anyone interested in fashion can benefit.

Although i’m a tech guy, I absolutely adore clothing and fashion. I believe that
 > clothing is a powerful form of self-expression, capable of offering a glimpse into someone’s personality from a single outfit. 

It’s an essential aspect of life as others always get a first impression from what you wear. Personally, I often struggle with planning outfits, despite spending alot of time thinking about them. I also like to plan my outfits of the week but have no place to save them. REHASH is a great tool that helps answer my desires as well as inspire others and build a community of those who appreciate a good fit.
