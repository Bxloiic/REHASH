Although i’m a tech guy, I absolutely adore clothing and fashion. I believe that
 > clothing is a powerful form of self-expression, capable of offering a glimpse into someone’s personality from a single outfit. 

It’s an essential aspect of life as others always get a first impression from what you wear. Personally, I often struggle with planning outfits, despite spending alot of time thinking about them. I also like to plan my outfits of the week but have no place to save them. REHASH is a great tool that helps answer my desires as well as inspire others and build a community of those who appreciate a good fit.
